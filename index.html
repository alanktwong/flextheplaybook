          <p class="lead">Renowned executive coaches and global leadership strategists offer lessons on the vital skill of “Flexing”—the art of switching leadership styles to more effectively work with people who are different from you. This critical skill allows managers to navigate successfully the diverse business environment of today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>The workplace around the world is changing -- growing increasingly multicultural, female, and younger. Experts often tell CEOs and managers what NOT to do, and corporate diversity programs can feel like defensive measures against lawsuits and harassment charges. While technology has connected all of us as a global workforce, it has not equipped us with the capability to interact genuinely with people around the globe.  We need the ability to build the trust required to achieve great outcomes in our workplaces by working with those who are different from us</p>
          <p>In order to be successful in this new global business environment, we need to re-think the way we lead and connect with others.</p>
          <p>Flex offers this new approach—a proactive strategy for managers to understand and leverage differences effectively in this new global economy.</p>
          <p>Flex shows managers how to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Understand the Power Gap, the social distance between you and those in the workplace of different cultures, ages, and gender.</li>
              <li>Flex your management style by stretching how you work and communicate with others.</li>
              <li>Bridge the gap with more effective communication and practical feedback tools.</li>
              <li>Multiply the effect, by teaching these skills to others and closing the power gap with clients, customers, and partners to create innovative solutions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Creating flex in a company’s management style will impact all aspects of developing the talent you have, attracting future talent and building relationships with customers in this competitive marketplace. Flex will show you how.</p>

        <p>We may produce and mail offers, coupons and information, including catalogues, to visitors to the Websites. We may also use lists we have received from third parties or public sources to send you this information. If you would prefer not to receive offline mailings from FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK relating to products found on the Websites, please contact your FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK Market Center using the information on the Contact Us page of the flexthenewplaybook.com Website to indicate that you would like to be removed from our mailing list.</p>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may conduct sweepstakes, contests and promotions, which ask visitors for personal information, such as contact information (name, email address, mailing address, etc.). Participation is optional. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on a Website, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the administration of such promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain additional specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. Personal information collected through sweepstakes, contests and promotions is also used to communicate with you regarding the promotion or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy or under the rules governing the promotion.</p>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may offer chat rooms, forums, message or bulletin boards, product rating and review areas, or interactive areas on the Websites where visitors may post comments or information for our visitors’ enjoyment. If there are chat rooms, bulletin or message boards, social networking opportunities or other interactive areas where personal information may be posted at a Website, be sure to check any posted rules before entering, as you will be bound by them as well as our Terms and Conditions. Rules for participation in interactive features may establish age and other restrictions on participation. As you know, anything you post online is available publicly for the world to see. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to information, including personal information that you voluntarily post. FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may publish your name, voice and likeness and other similar personal information in connection with any submissions you may make to the Websites, as set forth in our Terms and Conditions. You should be aware that FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may (but has no obligation to) publish your product-related comments, with or without attribution of those comments to you, on other websites owned by FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK.</p>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may receive information about you from other sources; as is customary in many businesses, we may purchase and use email lists to contact potential customers. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing our ability to serve you and to tailor content to you or other visitors. We ask those providing lists to give us assurances that email contact information is provided only for those consumers who have expressed a desire to receive offers and information by email. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Websites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information.</p>
        <h4>Non-personal information</h4>
        <p>Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personal information, which does not personally identify you, with our affiliates and with other third parties, for any purpose. For example, we regularly aggregate our sales and marketing information based on our customers’ orders. We use this information to be certain that we are offering the right products at the right time, and we like to understand what regions of the country order more products from us, what products are the most popular, and generally how our business is doing. We may also use non-personal information, such as technical data and information collected by or shared with third parties for internal business and marketing purposes, and to monitor security of the Websites.</p>
        <p>In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information (such as combining your name with your zip code or postal code). If we do combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information hereunder as long as it is so combined.</p>
        <h3>How is personal information shared with third parties?</h3>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK may perform or may employ third party service providers to perform certain business functions on our behalf. These functions may include (a) collecting personal information that you provide to us such as: name, address, phone number, email address, mailing address, and any other personal information you may volunteer, such as in connection with a survey; (b) fulfilling orders, including delivering packages; (c) analyzing data and providing marketing assistance; and (d) generating and revising customer lists. We seek to ensure that none of these third parties may use any personal information collected for any purpose other than to carry out their business function on our behalf.</p>
        <p>Personal information may be shared or combined between current or future affiliates, subsidiaries or other related entities of FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK for internal business and marketing/promotional purposes. Personal information may also be shared by FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK with other third parties for marketing/promotional purposes. You may opt-out of such sharing of your personal information at any time. Please see the "How can I opt-out" section below for more information on how to opt-out of such sharing of your personal information.</p>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK or any of its assets, including the Websites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal information is one of the key business assets for the transaction. In such a case, your personal information may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK reserves the right to disclose and transfer personal information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our assets, or other corporate change.</p>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK will release personal information and other collected information about you if you direct us to do so; if we believe we are required to, or as we believe to be appropriate under applicable law (including laws outside of your country of residence), to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other valid law enforcement measures; to comply with a legal obligation; at the request of public or governmental authorities (including authorities outside of your country of residence); to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Websites and applicable laws; or to protect the legal rights, privacy, interests, safety, property or operations of FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK, our affiliates, the Websites, visitors to our Websites or others, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain or in other legally limited circumstances. This includes exchanging information with third parties or organizations in connection with credit risk reduction and fraud protection. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
        <p>In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error, entry error, error in pricing information received from our suppliers, or other similar error, FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed through the Websites for product listed at the incorrect price. FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed.</p>
        <h3>Are there links on the Websites?</h3>
        <p>If FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK provides any links to websites owned by third parties or FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK affiliates on the Websites, these sites will operate independently from the Websites. We will not be and are not responsible or liable for any content or information collection practices of those pages or for such sites’ use of any personal information you provide to them, and we expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the policies relating to privacy and information collection and usage on any of such linked websites. Please review the policies of any website you visit.</p>
        <h3>How do the Websites serve advertisements?</h3>
        <p>We may use service providers to serve ads to you when you are on third-party websites, based only on your activity while you are on our Websites. For example, if you showed interest in a particular brand of coffee, we may serve an advertisement for that brand to you after you leave our Websites. In the course of serving our advertisements, our service providers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about it, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>How might this Privacy Policy change in the future?</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Websites. If you use one of our Websites following our posting of a revised Privacy Policy, your use of the Website will constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for changes or updates.</p>
        <h3>How can I opt-out?</h3>
        <p>We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Receiving electronic communications from us:</strong> If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by clicking on the opt-out link in any such email you receive from us; by logging into your flexthenewplaybook.com Website account, clicking on My Account from the homepage and making the appropriate selections in the "Email Notifications" section; or by contacting your FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK Market Center using the information on the Contact Us page of the flexthenewplaybook.com Website to indicate that you would like to be removed from our mailing list.</li>
            <li><strong>Our sharing of your Personal Information with our affiliates and other third parties:</strong> If you would prefer that we not share your Personal Information on a going-forward basis with our affiliates or with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this sharing by logging into your flexthenewplaybook.com Website account, clicking on My Account from the homepage and making the appropriate selections in the "Email Notifications" section, or by contacting your FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK Market Center using the information on the Contact Us page of the flexthenewplaybook.com Website to indicate that you would prefer that we not share your Personal Information on a going-forward basis with our affiliates or with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will seek to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of our affiliates or unaffiliated third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.</p>
        <h3>How can I access or change my Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK offers you the ability to correct your personal information by contacting your FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK Market Center using the information on the Contact Us page of the flexthenewplaybook.com Website. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to update or remove your personal information or restrict how we use your information, please use the Contact Us page. While FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK makes efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information, we reserve the right to delete customer information if we cannot reasonably accommodate a requested restriction.</p>
        <h3>What security measures does FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK have in place?</h3>
        <p>FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK takes commercially reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide. FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access, including through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software. SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it difficult for anyone else to intercept the personal information in the order information that you send us when you submit your online order. Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure. We seek to restrict access to information about you to those individuals who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request.</p>
        <p>Although FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK has implemented measures designed to secure personal information collected on our Websites from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes, nor can we guarantee that the transmission of data over the Internet that includes your personal information, or information storage technology, will be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "How can I contact FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK?" section below.</h3>
        <h3>How can I contact FLEX THE NEW PLAYBOOK?</h3>
