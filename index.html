          <p class="lead">Renowned executive coaches and global leadership strategists offer lessons on the vital skill of “Flexing”—the art of switching leadership styles to more effectively work with people who are different from you. This critical skill allows managers to navigate successfully the diverse business environment of today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>The workplace around the world is changing -- growing increasingly multicultural, female, and younger. Experts often tell CEOs and managers what NOT to do, and corporate diversity programs can feel like defensive measures against lawsuits and harassment charges. While technology has connected all of us as a global workforce, it has not equipped us with the capability to interact genuinely with people around the globe.  We need the ability to build the trust required to achieve great outcomes in our workplaces by working with those who are different from us</p>
          <p>In order to be successful in this new global business environment, we need to re-think the way we lead and connect with others.</p>
          <p>Flex offers this new approach—a proactive strategy for managers to understand and leverage differences effectively in this new global economy.</p>
          <p>Flex shows managers how to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Understand the Power Gap, the social distance between you and those in the workplace of different cultures, ages, and gender.</li>
              <li>Flex your management style by stretching how you work and communicate with others.</li>
              <li>Bridge the gap with more effective communication and practical feedback tools.</li>
              <li>Multiply the effect, by teaching these skills to others and closing the power gap with clients, customers, and partners to create innovative solutions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Creating flex in a company’s management style will impact all aspects of developing the talent you have, attracting future talent and building relationships with customers in this competitive marketplace. Flex will show you how.</p>
